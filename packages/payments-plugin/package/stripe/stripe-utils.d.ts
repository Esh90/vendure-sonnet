 * @description
 * From the [Stripe docs](https://stripe.com/docs/currencies#zero-decimal):
 * > All API requests expect amounts to be provided in a currency’s smallest unit.
 * > For example, to charge 10 USD, provide an amount value of 1000 (that is, 1000 cents).
 * > For zero-decimal currencies, still provide amounts as an integer but without multiplying by 100.
 * > For example, to charge ¥500, provide an amount value of 500.
 *
 * Therefore, for a fractionless currency like JPY, we need to divide the amount by 100 (since Vendure always
 * stores money amounts multiplied by 100). See https://github.com/vendurehq/vendure/issues/1630
